# Phin-security

I had a react auth skeleton that I usually use for projects, and that was used to set everything up initially.

I appreciate the opportunity for this.

The following is everything thats set, I didn't get the CRUD up and running, just need to connect all the pieces. I spent around 5-6 hours but didnt get the core requirements quite finsihed.

Structure set up with components. Database connected and set up. User Login mostly setup.

To check out components enter client and app.js.
Each will also have its own folder as well and would eventually have its own css.

To check out routes, enter server and click on routes. All routes set through app.js in server as well.

Proper styling and media query was not set up yet.

useContext and useState both implemented. useEffect not set up yet.
